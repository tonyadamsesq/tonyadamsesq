## About Me

<!--
**tonyadamsesq/tonyadamsesq** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
I'm a non-tech guys with 30+ years in global Project Management - so I've spent a lifetime working with brilliant tech people, around the world.  I've spent 10 years in cybersecurity and that's now my main industry / problem space.

I'm setting up a service offering that I can repeat with other clients, which means that I need to have my shit in a sock.  Scaleability, repeatability and automation are key to me being able to respond to opportunities.  So this repository is a space where I can learn and see how GitHub can help me with productivity.  

- I’m currently working on my PhD (Monash university) - building a conceptual framework to assist Pacific Island nations make policy decisions that boost their domestic cybersecurity capabilities.
- I’m currently learning how to use GitHub as a repository for me to self manage my productivity stuff
